This is my operating system class project to make an chat application between server and client using c++ with winsock2.h library
<br>
To run the server.cpp and Client.cpp file 
<br>
You have first g++ complier installed in your system 
<br>
Then After download the Code file
<br>
open cmd or terminal <br> 
Move to the folder where server.cpp and Client.cpp files are exist
<br>
to compile Server.cpp file type <br>
<code>g++ Server.cpp -o Server -lws2_32</code>
<br>
enter then type 
<br>
Server or ./Server
<br>enter to execute server file
<br>
Similarly for Client.cpp file Open new cmd or terminal
<br>
to compile Client.cpp file type <br>
<code>g++ Client.cpp -o Client -lws2_32</code>
<br>
enter then type 
<br>
Client or ./Client
<br>enter to execute Client file
